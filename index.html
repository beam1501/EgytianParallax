      <h1>Pyramids of Egypt</h1>
      <p>
        The Egyptian pyramids are ancient masonry structures located in Egypt.
        Sources cite at least 118 identified "Egyptian" pyramids.[1][2]
        Approximately 80 pyramids were built within the Kingdom of Kush, now
        located in the modern country of Sudan. Of those located in modern
        Egypt, most were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their
        consorts during the Old and Middle Kingdom periods.[3][4][5] The
        earliest known Egyptian pyramids are found at Saqqara, northwest of
        Memphis, although at least one step-pyramid-like structure has been
        found at Saqqara, dating to the First Dynasty: Mastaba 3808, which has
        been attributed to the reign of Pharaoh Anedjib, with inscriptions, and
        other archaeological remains of the period, suggesting there may have
        been others.[6] The otherwise earliest among these is the Pyramid of
        Djoser built c. 2630â€“2610 BCE during the Third Dynasty.[7] This pyramid
        and its surrounding complex are generally considered to be the world's
        oldest monumental structures constructed of dressed masonry.[8] The most
        famous Egyptian pyramids are those found at Giza, on the outskirts of
        Cairo. Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest
        structures ever built.[9] The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian
        pyramid. It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World
        still in existence, despite its being the oldest wonder by about 2,000
        years.
